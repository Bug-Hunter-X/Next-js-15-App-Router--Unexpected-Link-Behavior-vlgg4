# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected Link Behavior

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router where links generated using `next/link` do not navigate correctly. The issue is likely related to the new routing mechanism introduced in the App Router and how it interacts with client-side routing.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` component contains two links using `next/link`, one to the home page and another to an about page. However, clicking these links does not result in the expected page transitions.  The behavior might manifest as no change in the URL, a broken link, or unexpected routing behavior.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that clicking the links does not work as expected.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the links are correctly configured within the App Router structure and the pages are correctly defined. See the `bugSolution.js` for a corrected implementation.  It might involve adjustments to the page structure, file locations, or the use of `useSearchParams` hook for dynamic route handling.
